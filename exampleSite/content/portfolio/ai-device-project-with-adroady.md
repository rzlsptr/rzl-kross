#### AdroadyAI Project

##### About

Our idea to connect every OOH media platform extends to the very core of our tracking device, where our device can be installed modularly to every kind of OOH media. We want to provide analytical insights to our traditional fellows and bring them closer to the gate of digitalization.

On Demand,  this is our cloud solution for potential clients who are eager to collect data, but willing to outsource the storage and analytical aspects of it.

The value proposition that we offer is that in the world where big data reigns, agencies and media companies will be able to retrieve unique insights harvested from their big networks of OOH media. For example, we can construct heatmap for traditional OOH media networks so that they can update their pricing tiers periodically based on the data that our device provides them with via dashboard.

We also provide a media player device that can connect any HDMI-based digital media and provide them with access to our inventories. Our tracking software and sensors are also embedded within the device.

##### How it Works

From the AdroadyAI device, it detects movement, from people to public transport vehicles. AdroadyAI devices can be installed starting from indoor to signage, and outdoors such as on billboards, videotrons, and other media outlets.

After being detected from an AdroadyAI device, the data will be sent to the cloud, and as a client or media can see realtime streaming along with the data through the dashboard.

Our final goal is to present accurate and beautiful data that is ready to be presented to business partn
