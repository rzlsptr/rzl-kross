#### Project Details

This is my final project to get a bachelor's degree. The LRT project plan in Surabaya is the city government's plan for the procurement of a fast, modern, and integrated public transportation system. Not only the Surabaya City government plan, but the construction of the LRT is also a national plan because of the population of Surabaya city number 2 in Indonesia after the capital of Jakarta. In addition, the government will realize the city of Surabaya as a Smart city. However, this concept still gets a negative view of the community because of the view of existing transport in terms of security, comfort, and aesthetics that results in minimal public interest in mass public transport. This design was made as a design alternative and is expected to increase public interest in the use of public transport. The exterior of this LRT will be expected to represent the City of Surabaya and the Interior of this LRT will be expected to facilitate transportation access by various passengers. The presence of the LRT is expected to be a proud icon of Surabaya City and increase public enthusiasm for mass transportation within the city.

#### Design Concept

Interior LRT design concept, the keywords raised are Fresh Color, Modern, and Infinity View, which includes aesthetic concepts that elevate the characteristics of the city of Surabaya taken from cloverleaf. In this interior, there is a digital nameplate above the door, in the middle of the carriage, and above the dividing section between the carriages. In addition, above the door, there is an entrance and exit in the form of LED. For priority users, the seats are given a different color and have their own signage

The concept used in the making of the mascara form is Functional Semantics. The method used for the exterior is Mapping Forming, making the shape of the mascara according to the needs of existing parts, such as windows, emergency doors, lamps, and more. The keywords raised are Eye-catching, simple, and modern. LRT mascara has a detrainment door for emergencies. This door works using a gas spring and a linear actuator.
