#### Project Details

G-mink is a project for my college assignment, which is a styling project to create bag designs with a target market for design students who have a lot of assignments and luggage. This bag uses polyester and synthetic leather material, and also has wheels that can be pushed when you have a lot of luggage, like a suitcase.
