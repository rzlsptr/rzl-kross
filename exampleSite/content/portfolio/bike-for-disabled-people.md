#### Project Details

The Indonesian government has made efforts to make SIM D specifically for persons with disabilities using three-wheeled vehicles. However, the transportation equipment itself still does not meet ergonomic standards and also the special needs of each disabled with different levels and types of disabilities.

Based on this frame of mind, in an effort to increase the welfare and daily mobility of persons with disabilities, especially those with prosthetic feet, a special means of transportation is needed with the concept of "adjustable" and "organize" to answer the needs of users with this case study. It is hoped that the design of this special means of transportation can be produced and used by users of both foot prostheses to increase their productivity and mobility.
