##### Project Details

This project was when I did an internship at the INNO Design Center. Most of the projects here are related to railways and the direct clients are from PT INKA Indonesia.

#### Animation and Scaled Model Protoype of LRT Palembang

This project is to create an animation for the Palembang LRT for promotional purposes and a real illustration of how the Palembang LRT will work with the Palembang city environment. This project uses Solidworks for its basic 3D, uses 3DsMax for moving part animation, and rendering using the Lumion application.

Apart from working on the animation, we also made a scale model prototype of the Palembang LRT itself. The prototype is a series of carriages and mascara, complete with an interior. The interior is also complete with lighting just like the original atmosphere. This Scale Prototype Animation and Model was also exhibited at Grand City Surabaya in 2018 to show the mature concept of the Palembang LRT project.
